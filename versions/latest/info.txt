Installation instructions:
1. Unzip gameassets.zip to some folder. Copy the file path of the folder that contains the folder titled 'specialgamev1' (for me, bc specialgamev1 is at "M:/images/specialgamev1",
 it would be at "M:/images"), and insert it at line 216 (replace "M:/images" with the full file path of wherever you put the assets)
2. If you don't have Python 3.12 installed, do that now. (Official download for installer is at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)
3. Insert both python files (gamev2.py and glfw_postproc.py) at %localappdata%\Programs\Python\Python312\Lib (or if that folder does not exist, find the install folder for python and put it in the Lib
 subfolder (not the lowercase one))
4. Open up powershell. Run py -m pip install pygame PyOpenGl numpy pillow pyautogui pyperclip freetype glfw pyglm

To run:
In powershell, run py -m gamev2



If it instacrashes, let me know and send me the error msg


To Close: (sorry that this is messy)
1.click the close button on the active game window a few times
2.go into the powershell window you started the game with
3.press CTRL+C (in powershell) repeatedly until the game window closes
